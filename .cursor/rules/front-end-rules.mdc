### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when writing code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Vuetify helpers to style HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use "class:" instead of the ternary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have tabindex="0", aria-label, on:click and on:keydown, as well as similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible.
- Ensure good SEO practices
